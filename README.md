# The official code for *Large Audio AI Models for Instrumental Accompaniment in "Prelude: To Listening"*

## Abstract

This paper explores the innovative integration of Large Audio AI Models (LMs) with traditional Chinese music in the performance "Prelude: To Listening". Through the use of AI-generated audio accompaniment for the instruments sanxian, sanshin, and Chinese percussions, the project pushes the boundaries of sound art and experimental music. The study examines the creative potential of LMs, such as AudioLDM2 and Audiocraft, in generating novel sounds that deviate from exact replication, thereby offering fresh avenues for artistic expression. The paper highlights the conceptual innovation of using film subtitles as musical prompts, which imbues the audio with additional narrative and emotional layers. It also discusses the challenges of debugging LMs and the limitations of controlling audio features through text, emphasizing the need for more sophisticated methods to bridge text inputs and audio outputs. The performance, led by artist XXX XXX and supported by a team of collaborators, showcases the potential of LMs in the evolution of experimental music and sound arts.
